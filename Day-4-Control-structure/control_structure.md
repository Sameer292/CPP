# ⚡control structure in C++
###  #There are four types of control structure in c++
- Sequential control structure
- Selection control structure
- Iteration (Loops)
- Jumping statements

### 1.Sequential control structure
> Like the name suggests. It runs step by step in the program in a sequence. They execute whenever they appear.

```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){

int,a,b,c;
cout<<"Enter two numbers: "<<endl;
cin>>a>>b;
c=a+b;
cout<<"Their sum is: "<<c<<endl;

return 0;
}
```
> In this program every statement is run sequentially one after another.

### 2.Selection control structure
> This works according to the choice of the user. It gives a choice to select and according to the selection it executes the program.

> Conditions are put in these statements and the contitions are to be evaluated as either true or false i.e in boolean values.

> These are also called decision making statements.

> **⚡There are 5 types of selection statements**
- if()
- if().....else()
- else if() ladder
- nested if()
- switch

### 3.Iteration
> Iterations are basically loops. They continue the loop until a condition is met.

> **⚡There are 3 types of loops**
- for()
- while()
- do.......while()

### 4.Jumping Staements
> These are the unconditional branching statements. While the above statements require a condition to loop or to go to next statement. These are unconditional.

> **⚡There are 4 types of jumping statements**
- break
- continue
- return
- goto
